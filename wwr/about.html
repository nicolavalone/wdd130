            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Wild Rapids Adventures was founded in 1995 by a group of passionate outdoor enthusiasts who shared a love for adventure and a deep appreciation for nature. What started as a small rafting operation on the scenic rivers of the Pacific Northwest quickly grew into a renowned adventure company, offering a wide range of outdoor experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, Wild Rapids Adventures has expanded its offerings to include not only thrilling whitewater rafting trips but also guided hikes through lush forests, exhilarating zip line tours over breathtaking canyons, and serene kayaking excursions on tranquil lakes.
            </p>

                Our commitment to safety, professionalism, and environmental stewardship has earned us a reputation as one of the top adventure outfitters in the region. We take pride in providing unforgettable experiences for adventurers of all ages and skill levels, while also promoting conservation efforts to protect the natural wonders that we explore.
