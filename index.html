        Hello! My name is NÃ­cola Valone, and I live in Curitiba, Brazil. I love
        teaching English and Spanish, playing the guitar, and programming. I own
        my own business in Brazil, helping people to improve the quality of
        their communication in English and Spanish, using a method I've
        developed that helps the students to increase their confidence to speak
        a second language. I love spending time at home with my family, which
        includes my wife Adriana, and my three sons, Victor, Martin, and little
        Thomas. Since I work from home, I can do that a lot. I'm also a musician
        and have a YouTube Channel. Please,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC82pSXd1Ia7CkcdhUi5Tmaw"
          >check out my videos and SUBSCRIBE to my channel</a
        >!
